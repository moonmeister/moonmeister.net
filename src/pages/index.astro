				Hello! I am <b>Alex Moon</b> – a full-stack software developer and technologist.
				My career has spanned a help desk, systems administration, software development,
				Developer Relations, and more. I currently work as a Developer Advocate at
				<a href="https://wpengine.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
					>WP Engine</a
				>.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I am not working, I can be found hiking, skiing, contributing to
				Open Source, or wishing I was sailing (you can read more about my
				outdoor adventures on my <a
					href="https://www.gurugoes.net"
					target="_blank"><u>personal blog</u></a
				>). I am a dirt bag, so I might be doing any number of ridiculous
				things.
