I'll admit it...I've made it this far in my career and never really had to deal with authentication. The one project I worked on that had authentication I did non design or build anything...I just relied (probably for the worse) on co-workers.

For this blog and another blog I'm building I rely on WordPress as a back-end. I'm looking to use the WordPress comment system to enable comments. This may require some authentication of users so I decided to dive in...and wow is this a deep one.

I will probably write up a final solution (if I create one) but for now here are some great resources I've found.
