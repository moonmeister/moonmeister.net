Hi, I’m **Alex Moon** – a full stack software developer and operations engineer. My career has spanned a help desk, systems administration, and software development. When I am not working I can usually be found hiking, contributing to Open Source, or exploring Perth, Australia where I am currently living abroad.

I am currently looking for new job opportunity. Checkout my resume below for more info.
